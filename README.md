*Used https://codepen.io/cathydutton/pen/ldazc as the base of the code for this project as well as the Fridge project we worked on in class.  I used this site to analyze my code to make sure it was coded properly.  Learned an important lesson while developing the game.  The order of operations in html, css and java are very important for the game to work properly.

I added functions to calcaluate Wins and Loses.
