# Word-Guess-Game: 

This game is Harry Potter Hangman. The categories of words included are focused on Wizards, Hogwartz Houses, Quidditch, and the Book Titles.  

If you get stuck you can click the hint button to obtain a clue.

I added functions to calcaluate Wins and Loses.

Things to remaining:
    3-After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
    4-Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
    
*Used https://codepen.io/cathydutton/pen/ldazc as the base of the code for this project as well as the Fridge project and Rock Paper Scissors we worked on in class.  I also used this site to analyze my code to make sure it was coded properly.  Learned an important lesson while developing the game.  The order of operations in html, css and java are very important for the game to work properly. 

Also learned if you use capital letters for your alphabet you also need to use capital letters for words or the game can only identify the first word for every word but it won't recognize lowercase.
